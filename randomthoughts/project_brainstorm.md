# open source RPG + story

# key features 
- very low barrier of entry for adding to the world [e.g. should
require max 5 mins if im here]
- catchy thing to share with other people. this is probably not
straight prose but rather a more graphical proof of concept kind
of thing. 
- very high ceiling for what could possibly be created.

## "open source RPG"
so there is like a wiki. or something
people can create characters. or plot elements or something.
these get added to this page. then these can be imported into the
story. 

simultaneously, there is an RPG (probably just using the engine
    from any other game that i've already been part of creating)

so like maybe it's easy for people to contribute people and
places to the world.

potentailly could even have a mechanism by which people could
contribute to the github

it will be like a thing to have "world-building sessions"


there will be some kind of todo list kinda thing
to implement feature suggestions.


some random kind of weird ideas:
-- light cycle: day / night at night light is a bubble around you
-- maybe if you run really fast the light becomes a cone 

-- there are moving islands. TBD what on earth this could
possibly mean (how fast? how do you move between islands, etc)

## more misc thoughts
what if there are a lot of little stories that may not be so
important to other ppl

ok there can kind of be tiers of the plot. 

a dying world : causes a variety of problems

foremost is an actual main character + squad that must defeat
someone or something

maybe one person can solve the food problem ; one person can
solve the oppression problem .
