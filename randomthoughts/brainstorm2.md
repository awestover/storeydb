Sol was so tired. this wasn't particularly relevant as she had to
keep going regardless, but she made a point of acknowledging it.
Understanding yourself is something very important. If she didn't
know that she was tired she might place too much trust in her
instincts and reflexes. This could be very dangerous for a sailor
what if she was clumsy, lost her footing and fell to her death?
That wouldn't do! Although at least then she wouldn't have such a
bad headache. 

Sol surveyed her surroudings. The sea was a vast fairly calm blue
extending into the distance. The calm surface hid what she knew
to be underneath: sharks! This part of the waters had lots of
sharks that would eat her if she fell in the water. 
Or at least had in the past. There was so little to eat these
days that some large predators like sharks had a hard time
surviving. Didn't everyone. 

She looked down at the deck where her passengers were gathered in
discussion. These passangers were particularly insistent that
they arrive swiftly at their desination, but overall seemed like
quite nice people. 

She went down to check with her island-ogropher how long before
they were near the island the passengers wanted to go to. She
headed down the deck towards the captain's room. Before she could
get there however, one of the passengers approached her. 
"Sol! I'm glad I ran into you. You should get more sleep."
Sol felt a spike of shame: how did he remember her name? and why
couldn't she remember his? also how did he know she had been
having trouble sleeping? Mustering a what she judged to be a
moderately convicing cheerful countenance she responded with some
appropriate pleasentries, without revealing that she had
forgotten the passenger's name. 

"Have you observed any boats nearby?" the passenger asked,
cutting off her pleasentries, not rude rather as if oblivious
due to anxiousness. 

"I don't see what you're so worried about, " Sol said, "if there
is another boat we would see in plenty of time to avoid a
collision, even on a more misty day". 
It seemed her passengers had never been on the waters before.
Many people got quite annxious on the waters, but usually people
worried about storms or falling off the boat; not collisions.
