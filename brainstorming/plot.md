# world: Shara
- world is in a dreary state.
- major food shortages
- govt is kinda scary

- inhabitting creatures: 
  - humans; but use animal names for race
- tech: 
  - fairly low tech. they have boats though. but not super fast ones. 

- controlled by dragons they have a rigidly strict discipline
that they always claim is for the greater good
- the dragons have been incrementally decreasing all freedoms.
cancelled all holidays. discouraged ppl from attending school
and then just made it impossible. they cancelled hospitals. they
cancelled science. everyone must be a farmer or a sailor or
something that is working directly towards making food. 
- in the near future they are maybe planning on killing old
people and cancelling sailing

- oh also there are moving islands in the story! this makes
sailing a very difficult thing. the islands move because of
turtles

- Dragons maintain power in part via a monopoly on the
understanding and use of command-phrases
- Dragons are very invested in ensuring that the secrets of
command-phrases do not leave their small circle: with good
reason!

# magic: command-phrases ("commands")
* sight off | sight on
--- blind someone. let them see in the dark potentially?
* smell off | smell on
--- this is the secret one; smell off kills dragon. smell on
makes you take in a lot of air
* taste off | taste on
--- makes stuff taste good or lose your sense of taste.
* touch off | touch on
--- don't feel pain for a bit. incredibly sensitive to stuff
* sound off | sound on
--- hear nothing. hear really quiet things?

there is generally a 5 min cool down for these things, after
which affects of original command end and new command can be
given

The commands require magical braclets
But also it requires natural talent to be able to use the power,
as well as practice to use it in more refined ways.

command phrases can be used for blanket attacks versus people or
for more targeted and mroe specific stuff. (details tbd).
power of blanket attack is also correlated with natural talent
and practice.

**creation story**:
originally the world was just inhabited by animals. But they were
granted feelings, and then became what we would call humans. 

# more magic. 
Also there are a couple of teleporters. maybe. not really sure
how this one works.

# characters

## Dragons
Trying to do the altruistic right thing in misguided ways. also
slightly favors dragons a lot over other people.

Eventually, after being shook by Sol knowing the secret to
destroying them and choosing to give it up they are touched, and
step down from the position as oppressors. a multi-species
democracy is established and they all work together to improve
the world.

Anyone who will not accept their terms is punished harshly.

## Foxes
trying to lead Sol on a quest to destroy the dragons, although
she only catches onto this over time. originally its painted as a
quest to solve the food probelm, but its kind of revealed over
timem that they just want to destroy the dragons. 
eventually Sol will leave some of the not nice foxes and maybe
keep going with a nice one named Hap. 

## Koala
long history of being a seafaring people

## Sol [koala]
- dreams of exploring the ocean, charting the world
- values freedom a lot.

  - sometimes she struggles to be able to be the captain person
- she also really likes her dad, who is kinda old.
- Sol loves sunsets, feeling the wind, and rocking motion of the ship
in the waves

## Nezal [fox]
- not so nice. he and some people close to him really hate the
dragons a lot.

## Hap [fox]
- nice fox; kind of oblivious / akward; but very kind

## Alice [koala]
- tries to be kind of silly; kind of as a defence mechanism vs
dealing with serious situations
- she is in charge of. being a map expert.

## haosen [dragon]
- has been severtly wronged by the dragons. is kind of angry
which is why he's willing to help out. They help him escape from

Sol really looked up to her. 

## Second [koala]
lol second in command. also dies really fast. couldn't come up

# plot ideas

### chapter 1
- On boat with Foxes. Attacked by Dragons. They kind of defeat
the Dragons, but lose a lot of Foxes along the way and some
Dragons get away to report back. 
- it is revealed by the dragons that the dragons plan to soon get
rid of sailing and kill the old ppl so other ppl will have enough
food
- it is also discovered that Sol is passable at commands. (after the attack)
- she gets the braclets from a fallen fox 
- and she is kinda roped into the foxes plot thing because it
seems like a really good thing to do to her
- Sol is elevated to be first in command.

### more generally
- there is this quest: to get a braclet, and understand what it
does.
- along the way there are various obstacles in the sea and on the
lands that they must traverse, testing everyone's resolve.
- Sol thinks of a lot of ways out, but we keep the stakes high
for her. and she consistentally thinks  its like morally a good
thing to do. 

### quest outline
- initial attack
- need food: raid a farm 
- need a map to the place where the braclet is
- really bad storms to get to the braclet island. almost eaten by
sharks
- need to find island with this dude who can tell them how to use
the braclet
  -  hard to find but they manage in the end
- Sol ends up training a little bit. The teacher is wise and
teaches her not just how to use her powers, but when and why 
- the dragons find them, the hurrily escape on final leg of
journey: the word
- they find the word somewhere. it is revelad that the foxes are
low key evil too
- Sol is kind of paralyzed with uncertainty so just goes along
for a second but feels really bad
- finally as they approach the whatever they are gonna do to kill
the dragons, Sol assumes a crucial role, and falls into a
position where she can either condemn the dragons or the foxes.
she somehow cleverly chooses to do neither, but make some kind of
compromise
- later she somehow disposes of the braclet so she no longer is a
threat to the dragons, this frees her from future potential being
used by others 
- a lot of the world's problems don't go away. but it gets
a little bit more hopeful. The healing maybe will take some time.
But that's expected. many people only know of farming, and think
that farming is super important. which it is. but anyways what
Sol and her team did helps a bit. Sol is able to fulfill her
dream

# chapter 1, attempt 3

Sol was very tired. This wasn't particularly relevant as it was
mid-day: another 10 hours until she could conceivably rest. But
she made a point of acknowledging her fatigue anways.
Understanding yourself was very important. If she didn't
understand that she was tired she might place too much trust in
her instincts and reflexes. That in turn could be very dangerous
for a sailor: what if she was clumsy, lost her footing and fell
to her death? That wouldn't do! Although at least then she
wouldn't have such a bad headache. 

Sol surveyed her surroudings. From her height, the sea appeared
to be a vast unperturbed blue expanse extending into the
distance, some larger waves visible as ripples in the expanse of
blue. The calm surface hid what she knew to be underneath: a
world of life, fish and sharks! This part of the waters had lots
of sharks that would eat her if she fell in the water. Or at
least had in the past. There was so little to eat these days that
some larger predators like sharks had a hard time surviving.
Didn't everyone. 

She looked down at the deck where her Fox passengers were
gathered in discussion. The Foxish creatures shared a
characteristic sharp nose and eyes along with orange-ish hair.
Sol had always associated the race as being most comfortable in
forests, like their animal counterpart, and indeed they seemed
somewhat uncomfortable on the waters. Her race on the other hand,
the Koalas, had a long history of sea-faring. Sol loved
the ocean. Even accounting for their uneasiness at see, Sol's fox
passangers seemed particularly insistent
that they arrive swiftly at their desination. 
They were something of an anxious group, but
overall seemed like quite nice people. 

Sol headed down to check with Alice, the ships island-ogropher
how much longer until they would reach the passenger's
desitnation island. She headed down the deck towards the
navigation room. Before she could get there however, one of the
passengers approached her. "Sol! I'm glad I ran into you. You
should get more sleep." Sol felt a spike of shame: how did he
remember her name? And why couldn't she remember his? Also how
did he know she had been having trouble sleeping? Mustering 
what she judged to be a moderately convicing cheerful countenance
she responded with some appropriate pleasentries, without
revealing that she had forgotten the passenger's name. 

"Sol, have you observed any boats nearby?" the passenger asked,
cutting off her pleasentries, not rude rather as if too
distracted to keep track of unimportant things.

"I don't see what you're so worried about, " Sol said, "the
dragons keep very tight control over these waters. The days when
one could survive as a pirate on these waters are long gone. All
ships we pass will be peaceful trading vessles, closely regulated
by the dragons more likely than not". Many people got quite
anxious on the waters, but usually people worried about storms or
falling off the boat, not pirates. Although Sol did not generally
appreciate the dragons encroaching on the ocean, and personally
was still proud to be part of the crew of a privately owned ship
owner rather than a ship owned by the dragons, she did have to
admit that the waters were safer for the dragons intervention.

"Yes, yes, of course" the man replied. "All the same, please let
me know immediately if you do see a ship." 

Sol placated the fox with promises that she would of course
inform him of any ships they saw, and then continued on to the
navigation room to confer with Alice, the ship's map expert, trying to
shake off the slight sense of unease that the man's worry had
left her with. There really was no need to be worried, she had
sailed for many years! Yes, sailing was dangerous. She knew many
people who had lost careless passengers to the waters. Getting
caught in a storm was far worse, she had heard tales of
unfortunate ships caught in storms. But danger from other ships?
Not likely now adays. Sol supposed the foxes were just anxious
and worried about irrational things.

"Good morning Sol"! Alice exclaimed without looking up as she
walked in. "How are you?" 
"Fine" she said forcibly pushing down the pain of her headache. 
"Although it's hardly morning! Can I take a look at the maps?"
"Ah! your entrance brings sunshine to the room, I must have
mistaken that for it being morning." Alice glibly
retorted. "The maps are on the table".

Sol snorted and sat down at the desk, trying to study the maps. 
Island-ography was a complex art: they had a position map synced
at their last island stop-point and had estimates of island
trajectories. But of course, these were only local estimates and
quickly diverged from reality. They were headed towards a larger
island where they were supposed to restock on food before
continuing their journey. It shouldn't be too hard to run into,
but she tried to check the calculations herself. She couldn't do
it, her mind scattered into different threads as she tried to
concentrate on the problem. She once again was reminded how
painful her headache was. Whenever she got like this even the
most simple tasks seemed impossible. Her whole body tingled as if
some kind of charged blood ran through her viens making her itch
to move. But the thought of moving also paralyzed her. With
effort she dragged herself out of the state of motionlessness.
Moving around, finding distractions always helped. If she went
fast enough sometimes she could forget the fatigue. 

"Have the crew seen anything strange?" she asked Alice. "The
passengers are being being weird about it again."
"Nothing strange. Weather patterns all look normal, haven't
passed many ships, but that's not too uncommon these days. The
dragons don't exactly encourage sailors these days. say it's
taking people away from the farms."
The thought angered Sol. As if the sailors would be of more use
in the farms. Sailors served an essential function for Shara. And
yet, the same had been said of education, which now was nearly
elminated by the dragons in the name of survival.
Sol wondered what kind of a world the dragon's thought they were
creating. What point was food if you couldn't live? explore?
She herself would never be a farmer, regardless of however the
dragons tried to restrict their freedoms. They would not steal
the ocean from her!

"Well, all the same let me know if you do see any other ships. I
promissed our fox friends". "ez!" Alice replied.

"Alice, why do you sail?" Sol asked. 
"Makes good money!" Alice exclaimed. 
"No it doesn't". "with the taxes the dragons charge for us to
'license' our ship there's hardly enough for food!"
"Well, I didn't say it makes me good money. Someone's probably
getting rich though" Alice joked.
Sol fell silent. Alice usually wasn't the most serious person she
knew. She could understand that: being too serious could be
dangerous, sometimes it was better to avoid these things.
Alice made to leave the room, but as she did Alice whispered
"because it's beautiful. it's hard sometimes. but I do it to
see the sea. I do not think, having this long been with the sea I
could stand the thought of replacing it with a farm field."
Sol continued on and went to check on the crew. 

-----

Hours later, Sol stood at the prow of the ship to watch the sun
fall into the sea. It was spectacular. In the background she
could hear the familiar sound of Captain Lisa ordering crew
around on various tasks. All around, she heard and felt the crash
of the ship plowing through the water. This part of the ship felt
the strongest the rock of the ship due to waves. The wind
buffetted her backwards, but she stood firm delighting in its
touch on her face. She stood there for a long while: she was off
duty, second in command would be serving as the captian's
assistant at the moment. Darkness fell and the ship continued to
push forward through the waves. Eventually
Sol turned away and went to bed. 

-----

She woke to someone shaking her softly. "What wrong?" "Dragon
ship approaching." Alice responded, "Maybe wants to inspect our
ship or something? I'm sorry to wake you, but captain said it was
important for you to see how to deal with a situation like this."
One of Lisa's favorite sayings "you'll never learn something new
if you force yourself to rely on your old way of learning". Sol
found captain to be very wise, but someitmes that wisdom was
pretty inconvenient. Groaning silently she got up and headed to
the main deck where Lisa stood. Her body helpfully provided a
surge of adreniline to counterbalance the fact that she was
opperating on like 4 hours of sleep. She knew it would wear off
soon though, leaving her feeling much worse.

As Alice had said, the approaching ship appeared to be a standard
Dragon patrol ship. The dragon's were very strict about enforcing
their law. It wouldn't be a problem, Lisa had the necessary
documents. But it was certainly an annoyance, especially at this
time of night. "Can you tell one of the Foxes", Sol whispered,
"I--" "I know. on it!" Alice exclaimed and rushed energetically
to find a fox. 

The fox, barely awakened by Alice, ran to look. "No! They've
found us." the fox cursed. "It'll be fine" she said.
"No! Can we escape it?" 
"Not really. It takes some time to change the direction of a
ship this big!"
"no, no, no!" the fox hyperventilated. "We were so careful"
Sol's stomach sank. Were the foxes fugitives from
the dragons or something? This could get bad. 

Suddenly, her vision went black. The other crew members and foxes
screamed. "What happened?" "I can't see!"

"It's the dragons. they have the command of sight."
Command-phrases? the dragons magic that partially enabled their
control of Shara. She didn't really know how they worked, but
there were supposedly 10 command phrases: one to somehow turn on
or off each sense. The commands were generally used more as a
fear tactic to keep people from resisting and rarely actually
used, but occasionally Sol would hear stories about people who
claimed to have been blinded or frozed by a command. She had been
skeptical, but now couldn't doubt: the phrases power was clearly
very real and currently obstructing her sight. The dragons had
come to capture the Foxes. Or worse.

They had bigger problems too. What about steering the ship? "Stop
the ship!" Lisa yelled, with the same thought. "We don't want to
crash into anything." "We'll wait. there's probably just some
kind of misunderstanding" "No!" the fox yelled. "We have to escape."

Suddenly she heard the sound of wings and then several large
thumps: clearly dragons were dropping to the deck. How had they
gotten so close so fast? Dragons couldn't really fly, but there
arms had wings on them which allowed them to at least glide. 

"Nezal!" a dragon roared from the deck. Sol knew her way aroud
the ship even without sight. She hurried as consipcously as she
could to a spot where she could hear but hopefully not be seen by
the dragons. "We know you seek the dragon-key". "You
would enslave the dragons or kill them!"

"We seek freedom for Shara! " a fox, apparently Nezal challenged. 

"There is no time for such inefficiency. We come with an offer
of peace. relinquish your quest. We will permit you to live as
farmers, closely supervised."

"Never!" Nezal shouted.

Sol's vision was starting to return a little bit. Chaos ensued:
Sol observed in horror from her hiding spot as the dragons
attacked the foxes and other crew members indiscriminantly with
metal rods. She wished she could help protect any of them but she
was no warior. She found herself frozen in shock as the attack
ensued. She watched with her eyes but was not really processing
or registering most of what happened. The dragons pushed a fox
off this ship: he would be eaten by sharks soon. Lisa ran to the
front of the prow and yelled: "STOP!". The dragon's instictively
stopped, this was not a sound of someone to be disobeyed. Lisa
was an amazing captain. Sol marvelled at how in the face of such
a difficult situation Lisa could show such courage. The reason of
course was simple: Lisa took the safety of her crew as her
personal responnsibility and was not one to shy from
responsibility. One day Sol wished she could be as awesome as
Lisa. For now she remained cowering in her hiding spot.

"This is insanity" Lisa stated calmly. "You dragons clearly have
some quarel with the foxes. But you are all on *my* ship. You can
either work this out peacefully or work it out once we dock. This
does not concern my crew and you are acting against the law! If
you continue like this --"
she was cut off as a dragon pushed off from the deck and flew
towards her with remarkable momentum. The dragon hit the deck
right in front of Lisa and shoved her over the side with ease.
The comotion commenced and the interuption seemed quickly
forgotten. Not by Sol. She couldn't process. Her brain refused to
compute anything. It just ran in cycles: Lisa fell over the boat.
What happened to her? Where was Lisa? It didn't compute that she
was dead, eaten by sharks. Lisa wasn't the kind of person that
died. She was strong, immovable. But then, where was she? Sol
didn't feel pain. She just felt very confused. She felt that she
could remember being able to think, but couldn't quite remember
what it was like.

Her brain still moving incredibly slowly, she became aware that
the foxes all had sunglasses on. Several foxes lit fire to the
deck. Nezral, standing in the center of the deck said something,
that she couldn't quite make out. He spoke not particularly
loudly, but felt that she could just almost understand. Her
vision burned. The inverse effect of the vision removal that
she had experienced a moment ago. The dragon's shrieked and
tide turned. Though her vision watered, from her sheltered
position Sol was not rendered painfully blind like the dragons,
and could clearly see that now the foxes, unperturbed by the
light were shoving dragons off the deck. One of the dragons
called for a retreat. "You will not succeed!" the dragon's
yelled as the small remnant of the dragon force glided off. The
remaining foxes offered no reply. 

"We need to put out the fires and get away fast" Alice shouted
from the deck. "You five: start pulling buckets of water, you
five help them throw it on the fire. you five: check for wounded
people and see if there is anything you can do to help them."
The crew rushed to their tasks.

"Second?" Alice yelled. "Sol?"

Sol crawled out from her hiding spot. 
"Can you steer the ship?"

Sol didn't reply, but her body moved mechanically to the
steering-wheel. 

"what heading?" Sol managed with effort. She did not think. 

"away!" Alice yelled. That was simple enough. Sol 
grabbed the wheel and dragged the ship on a new course.
