setting:
its kind of a burnt-out world with a lot of man-made things and
a lot of destroyed stuff.
nature is quite an oddity, but can be found in some places.

many of the people work at factories doing meaninless work. There
is a lot of ash and smoke. it's a pretty dark poluted place.

Sol:
strengths:
- sometimes incredibly intelligent and capable
weaknesses:
- sometimes this turns off 
- faced with dehabilitation 

friend 1:
also has some problems. they help each other out. 


the plot:
Sol dreams of a more beautiful world. There is some kind of idea
of a radical change to the world to improve it for the better
radically. this turns out to be evil: the people they were
fighting against weren't actually bad; eventually Sol realizes
that the world already has lots of beauty and he does things to
make hte world locally more beautiful. 
the real enemy is the "preconceived notions" that people are too
prideful to abandon. Sol goes through a process of making
realizations about himself, which culminates in 

the world becomes more beautiful as a result of choices. 




tired, scared, apathetic, paralyzed. and then little beautiful
things happened; someone cared, listened, believed, accepted.
someone tried, in a ridiculous way, to help. 
that's all it takes.
