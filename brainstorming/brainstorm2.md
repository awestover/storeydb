Sol was very tired. This wasn't particularly relevant as she had to
keep going regardless, but she made a point of acknowledging it.
Understanding yourself is something very important. If she didn't
know that she was tired she might place too much trust in her
instincts and reflexes. This could be very dangerous for a sailor
what if she was clumsy, lost her footing and fell to her death?
That wouldn't do! Although at least then she wouldn't have such a
bad headache. 

Sol surveyed her surroudings. The sea was a vast fairly calm blue
extending into the distance. The calm surface hid what she knew
to be underneath: sharks! This part of the waters had lots of
sharks that would eat her if she fell in the water. 
Or at least had in the past. There was so little to eat these
days that some large predators like sharks had a hard time
surviving. Didn't everyone. 

She looked down at the deck where her passengers were gathered in
discussion. These passangers were particularly insistent that
they arrive swiftly at their desination, but overall seemed like
quite nice people. 

She went down to check with her island-ogropher how much longer
until they would reach the passenger's desitnation island. She
headed down the deck towards the captain's room. Before she could
get there however, one of the passengers approached her. 
"Sol! I'm glad I ran into you. You should get more sleep."
Sol felt a spike of shame: how did he remember her name? and why
couldn't she remember his? also how did he know she had been
having trouble sleeping? Mustering a what she judged to be a
moderately convicing cheerful countenance she responded with some
appropriate pleasentries, without revealing that she had
forgotten the passenger's name. 

"Have you observed any boats nearby?" the passenger asked,
cutting off her pleasentries, not rude rather as if oblivious
due to anxiousness. 

"I don't see what you're so worried about, " Sol said, "if there
is another boat we would see it in plenty of time to avoid a
collision, even on a more misty day". 
It seemed her passengers had never been on the waters before.
Many people got quite annxious on the waters, but usually people
worried about storms or falling off the boat, not collisions.
If two ships got too close to one another, called a collision, it
would draw sharks. One ship on its own usually could sneak past
the sharks. 

"Yes, yes, of course" the man replied. "I do not doubt your crews
abilities. All the same, please let me know immediately if you do
see a ship."

Sol consoled the man and then continued on to the captains room
to confer with Bob, their map expert, trying to shake off the
slight sense of unease that the man's worry had left her with.
There really was no need to be worried, she had sailed for many
years! Yes, sailing was dangerous. She knew many people who had
lost careless passengers to the waters. Getting caught in a
storm was far worse, she had heard tales of unfortunate ships
caught in storms. But collisions, though not unheard of, were
extremely rare. 

[some more scene setting]

[they're attacked]

[for some reason she now takes the responsibility of doing some
hard thing]




## basic world and plot building
sol arc: takes on some responsibility to do something good
not consistently sure she cares

Shara: not lots of food
there has been intense drought or something

Bob: ostensibly the enemy

maybe there are 2 bands of ppl. 

what if the maincharacter was kind of not sure that they
were good or bad or  didnt care

ok so [bad guys] are in control of Shara.
what do [bad guys] do?
they kill ppl because of the starvation
they have developed a rationing system

some people are mistreated under the rationing system or whatever 

brutal punishment to people that try to oppose the system.
